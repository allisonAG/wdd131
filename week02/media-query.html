            <h2>Ether 12:4</h2>
            <p>Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God,
            which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always
            abounding in good works, being led to glorify God.</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my
            grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have
            faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>
